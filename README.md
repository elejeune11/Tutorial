# Tutorial on ML for small datasets

We will go through the slides + the Jupyter notebooks, all code is in this repository for you to download **later**!

To run a Jupyter notebook, you need to follow these instructions: 
https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

I like using Anaconda:
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Note: all of the code should work just fine if you copy/paste into Python rather than using Jupyter

Python packages used: 
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn.gaussian_process
* pyDOE
* SALib
* skgstat
* pysal
* seaborn

Note: there (should be) equivalent methods in MATLAB.
